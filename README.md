# Web Scrapers Project
This is a work-in-progress project that will contain web scraping scripts to extract data from various websites. The scripts will be written in Python and use popular libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy.

Check back soon for updates!

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- BeautifulSoup
- Scrapy
- Selenium 

### Usage
Each scraper is contained within its own folder and can be run by executing the corresponding Python script. The extracted data is usually saved to a database or JSON file.

Before running any scraper, make sure to read the instructions in the scraper's folder and install any additional dependencies that may be required.

### Disclaimer
Web scraping can potentially violate the terms of service of the websites being scraped. Use these scripts at your own risk and make sure to read and comply with the website's terms of service before scraping.
